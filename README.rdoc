= Faye::Redis {<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/faye/faye-redis-ruby.png" alt="Build Status" />}[http://travis-ci.org/faye/faye-redis-ruby]

This plugin provides a Redis-based backend for the {Faye}[http://faye.jcoglan.com]
messaging server. It allows a single Faye service to be distributed across many
front-end web servers by storing state and routing messages through a
{Redis}[http://redis.io] database server.


== Usage

Pass in the engine and any settings you need when setting up your Faye server.

    require 'faye'
    require 'faye/redis'
    
    bayeux = Faye::RackAdapter.new(
      :mount   => '/',
      :timeout => 25,
      :engine  => {
        :type  => Faye::Redis,
        :host  => 'redis.example.com',
        # more options
      }
    )

The full list of settings is as follows.

* <b><tt>:uri</tt></b> - redis URL (example: redis://:secretpassword@example.com:9000/4)
* <b><tt>:host</tt></b> - hostname of your Redis instance
* <b><tt>:port</tt></b> - port number, default is +6379+
* <b><tt>:password</tt></b> - password, if +requirepass+ is set
* <b><tt>:database</tt></b> - number of database to use, default is +0+
* <b><tt>:namespace</tt></b> - prefix applied to all keys, default is <tt>''</tt>
* <b><tt>:socket</tt></b> - path to Unix socket if +unixsocket+ is set
